This is what needs to be done to my understanding:

    linear file database:
        allocate         - Andrew
        checkpoint       - Clement
        key storage      - Asmaa
        value storage    - Asmaa
        disk space       - Tanner

    node:
        Needs revise     - Tanner
        

Of course, this is just an outline, and it does not hurt your peers to lend a helping hand :)
