This is what needs to be done to my understanding:

    linear file database:
        allocate         - Andrew
        checkpoint       - Andrew
        key storage      - Clement
        value storage    - Asmaa
        disk space       - Tanner

    node:
        Key node         - Clement
        Value node       - Asmaa
        

Of course, this is just an outline, and it does not hurt your peers to lend a helping hand :)

*Double check that this is right! And of course we can help one another on any issues that show up.*
